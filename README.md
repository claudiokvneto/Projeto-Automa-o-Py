Development of an automated script, requested by the CISS S.A. performance team, with the aim of scanning the entire system in search of unused objects, methods and branches. 

The script analyzes source codes and, through comparisons made in VS Code, identifies the existence of obsolete elements. If it finds any unused objects or methods, it saves them in a folder for possible recovery and removes them from the sources. 

With this script, it was possible to delete more than 700 objects and more than 10,000 methods that were causing system slowdowns and crashes, resulting in an estimated saving of three weeks of work.
